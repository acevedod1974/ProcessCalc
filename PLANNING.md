# Planning & Roadmap for ProcessCalc

This document outlines the vision, goals, and future direction for the ProcessCalc project.

## Project Vision

ProcessCalc aims to be the go-to educational and engineering tool for simulating, analyzing, and optimizing manufacturing processes. It should be accessible, visually engaging, and technically robust, serving both students and professionals.

## Core Principles

- **Accuracy:** Calculations should reflect real-world engineering as closely as possible.
- **Clarity:** UI and results must be easy to interpret, with clear recommendations and visual indicators.
- **Extensibility:** The codebase should allow for easy addition of new processes, materials, and features.
- **Education:** Provide context, explanations, and resources to help users learn as they use the tool.

## Roadmap

### Short Term (0-3 months)

- Finalize and polish all core modules (cutting, deformation, machining)
- Complete all input validation and error handling
- Expand educational resources and in-app explanations
- Add export and sharing features for results
- Improve accessibility and responsive design

### Medium Term (3-6 months)

- Add more materials and process types (e.g., advanced alloys, non-metals)
- Implement user authentication and personal history
- Add unit and integration tests for all calculation logic
- Optimize performance for large datasets and histories
- Begin work on multi-language support

### Long Term (6-12 months)

- Integrate with external engineering databases/APIs
- Add advanced simulation/visualization features (e.g., stress/strain plots)
- Develop a mobile-friendly version or PWA
- Build a community-driven library of process templates and best practices

## Stretch Goals

- AI-powered process optimization and recommendations
- Real-time collaboration and sharing
- Certification or learning modules for students
